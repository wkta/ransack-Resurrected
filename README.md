## About

The project consists in a remake of old indie games (roguelike genre).
Our inspiration comes from a software
initially built with by pygame and authored by *Dan Allen*,
and also from a game name
"The enchanted cave" by *Dustin Auxier*.

Now we are using the `pyved-engine` + Python3.
The new project maintainer is [moonb3ndr](https://github.com/wkta).


## How to run the game?

**Important**: Firstly you need python3. Secondly, our game depends on the `pyved_engine`:
a work-in-progress [game engine](https://github.com/gaudiatech/pyved-engine)

It also depends on libraries that are listen in the `requirements.txt` file.

To install all these dependencies takes some time, but you need to do this only once!

It is recommended to proceed as follows:
1. download both ravenous caves, and *the custom game engine* on your computer.
The best option is to use git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wkta/ravenous-caves.git
```
And then
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gaudiatech/pyved-engine.git
```
2. using the command line, navigate to the folder that **contains ravenous caves**.
3. setup a new virtual environment by typing `python -m venv venv` and activate that virtual environment, for example on windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
4. install all basic requirements by typing ...
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. using the command line, navigate to the folder that contains the game engine.
6. install the engine within the current (still active) virtual environment. You can do that
by typing ... (see pip documentation and "editable mode" installation if you wish to learn more)
```shell
pip install -e .
```
7. go back to the folder **that contains ravenous caves** and type...
```shell
python main.py
```
